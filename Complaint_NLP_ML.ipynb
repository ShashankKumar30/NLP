       "Equifax mishandled my information which has led to a breach that puts myself and millions of others at potential risk. I am extremely disappointed with how equifax has handled reporting this breach. Very little was done to notify the public for nearly a month after the breach was detected. I received no email, letter, or phone call and instead had to discover it via social media.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    118\n",

The agent stated that this account is mine and payments were made from this account. I agreed with him that account # XXXX was my account but no payments was ever made from this account in XX/XX/XXXX. Payments were however made from my bank account ending in XXXX to my original Capital One account ending in XXXX several years prior to XX/XX/XXXX. My original Capital One bill has been paid in full for years which clearly shows that on my credit report. \\nI was then told the payments were also debited from \" XXXX Bank '', which is a bank I have never done business with. After much conversation with the agent and getting nowhere I stated I would take other measures to get this false information off of my credit record. He then stated that \" XXXX XXXX '' know owns the debt.
